      "One of the most popular bamboo plants in the United States. It can reach heights of 30 feet but more typically it is in the 10-20 foot range.  It can spread aggressively so plant it carefully and keep it contained.  Planting between hardscape elements helps with this so it makes an excellent screening or privacy hedge for a driveway or walkway planting.",

    toxicity_description:
      "This plant is almost not toxic to pets or humans. Before they can be eaten, they have to be cut like fibrous parts, and then the sprouts need to be boiled. When eaten raw, bamboo contains a toxin that produces cyanide in the intestine.",
    sun_exposure:
      "Bamboo prefers a spot that gets full sun to partial shade. Too much shade can result in a weak plant that does not grow to its fullest potential or develop its brilliant color. Indoors, keep your bamboo by your brightest window, and rotate the pot every week or so to be sure all sides of the plant get light.",

      "All cactus plants are members of the Cactaceae family, and there are thousands of species in all. There are two large groups of cacti grown as houseplants: desert cacti and forest cacti. Both are popular and familiar, and both can thrive indoors with relatively little maintenance. Cactus plants come in many sizes, but most indoor varieties are small to moderate.",

Cattleya orchids typically feature showy, fragrant flowers that come in a wide variety of shapes, colors, and color combinations.

However, any harsh midday sun that comes through the window should be diffused with a sheer curtain. Similarly, the orchids like outdoor sunlight in the morning but should be protected from the strong afternoon sun.",

Up until 2017, it was botanically classified as Sansevieria trifasciata, but its commonalities with Dracaena species were too many to overlook. The plant features stiff, sword-like leaves ranging from 6 inches to 8 feet tall.",
